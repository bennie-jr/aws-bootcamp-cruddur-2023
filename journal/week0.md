# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Tasks

### Watch the videos
I was able to watch the live stream for week 0, Chirag's tutorial on spend considerations and Ashish's tutorial on security consideration.

### AWS Requirements
I was able to create an IAM user with full administrator access.

I was able to use aws cloudshell.

Also, I was able to generate security credentials on my aws account which are the access key and security key.

I was able to install the aws cli on gitpod cde and I can reference that with the link to the [gitpod yaml file](https://github.com/bennie-jr/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/.gitpod.yml) in repo

### Create a Budget
I created a budget with a spend of $5 because i cannot afford any kind of spend. I also created just one budget because i did not want to exceed the free tier limit on budgets.
